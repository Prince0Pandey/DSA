<ins>**Data Structure</ins> :** A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.

**<ins>Algorithm</ins> :** Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output

**<ins>Characteristics</ins> :**
<pre>
1. The steps in the Algorithm need to be in a Specific Order.
2. The steps also need to be Distinct.
3. The Algorithm should produce a Result.
4. The Algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

### Types of Data Structure

**<ins>Primitive(Built-in/Primary)</ins> :** Primitive data type is a fundamental data type that cannot be broken down further into simple data type. They have fixed size.  
Example : integer, float, string and boolean.

**<ins>Non Primitive</ins> :** Non primitive data structures is a type of data structure that can store the data of more than one type. 
They does not have fixed size.  

Non Primitive are also divided into 2 types <ins>Linear</ins> and <ins>Non-Linear</ins>  

**<ins>Linear</ins> :** Linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are stored in a linear sequence.
Examples : List, Tuple, Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue.

**<ins>Non Linear</ins> :** Non Linear data strucutres is a form of data structure where the data elements don't stay arranged linearly or sequentially.  
Examples : Set, Dictionary, Tree, Graph

**<ins>Buit-in Non Primtive Data Strucutres</ins> :** List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary

**Big O Notation**  
O(1)     : Constant Time  
O(N)     : Linear Time
O(logN)  : Logarithmic Time
O(NlogN) : QuasiLinear Time  
O(N^2)   : Quadratic Time
